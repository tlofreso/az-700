# Technical notes for the AZ-700 course
This repo contains various patterns I used to implement the hands-on exercises within the [AZ-700](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/design-implement-microsoft-azure-networking-solutions-az-700/) training course. There are a number of ways to deploy configurations within Azure:  

 - [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/)
 - [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/?view=azps-9.2.0)
 - [ARM Templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/)
 - [Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/)
 - [Terraform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/)

I'll try to use a variety of the methods above in an effort to gain a better understanding of their advantages / disadvantages.
